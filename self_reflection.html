        <h2>Personal Values</h2>
        <p>I was born the youngest child in a Christian Family, Singapore. At first I was Conservative Christian, Communist then now I am back to being a Conservative Libetarian.</p>
        <p>Reason for my upbringing as conservative is because of my life in Singapore. It's a very diverse country but at the same time had a good amount of nationalistic pride.</p>
        <p>Singaporeans don't look at each other with race in mind but with merit. It taught me in order to make it in the world you have to be sucessful in order to survive. I learned at my time in New Zealand that that holds true most of the time but some people do need a chance.</p>
        
        <p>I have never had a time where my values questioned until I entered my national service in Singapore. National Service is conscription where at the age of 18 every Male has to serve for their country. I serve my time for Singapore in the Police Force.</p>
        <p>During a patrol there was a gathering of Indians in the morning under a pavalion in Jalan Bukit Merah, a housing development area in Singapore. There wasn't anything really suspicious to me and my partner wanted to screen them. The Indians got anoyed and wanted to leave. I screened two but one decided to walk away. I felt the whole time that we were just screening them because my partner wanted to fill a quota. So I let that man go. My partner was livid and angry that I let that man go. The security of the people should be put first and I failed that time to fulfil my duty. Yes I may feel that there may be some kind of discrimination because they were foreign nationals but I should never put my nations security over that feeling.</p>
        <p>The consequence of that action affected my relationship with my patrol partner and she didn't have much trust in my abilities at that time which in turn affected my performance in doing my duties as well.</p>

        <h2>Strengths and Limitations</h2>
        <p>After talking and discussion with peers this is what I have found.</p>
        <p>I am passionate in work that I am interested in. Problems are that I can focous to much on what I am interested in instead of spreading the time out for the other tasks. It's kind of like tunnel vision.</p>
        <p>I talk about a topic passionately but end up cutting into what people say or change to topic entirely without clear flow in coversation.</p>
        <p>I like to tell the true but I am too blunt to some people and failed to see from other peoples perspective.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>In terms of career development there are times where I felt Imposter syndrome and I loose motivation and confidence in my abilities.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>I have had a bad exprience working in a User Interface design project with 3 other teamates. There were two teamates that didn't get along. One was an Apple fanatic, let's call him Sam, and the other wanted to get the work done without delay, let's call him David.</p>
        <p>We were all working on a garden management application. Same wanted the UI to be based on Apples IOS design. He also insited in using Sketch which had a problem. No one had Sratch on their computer or knew how to use it. This lead to a disagreement with Sam and David. The project delayed because of failed meetups.</p>
        <p>Sam wasn't budging and I had to find a solution. I decided to look for places to run Sketch as a trial and found a spot in the University Library that had Mac Computers. I installed the trail and began work on the project.<p>
        <p>I informed the team about this information and told them that if we do not finish our project we would fail the assignment. It didn't really work till it was the day before the drop in date.</p>
        <p>The group was together finally but Sam and David were still at each other. I choose to ignore them and continue working on Sketch till we had enough windows to do a walkthrough.</p>
