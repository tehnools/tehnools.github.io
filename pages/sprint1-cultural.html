                    <p>
                        I was born in Singapore. Over there we have culture based on merit and not on race. I grew up on
                        those values and still to this day.
                        However I also learned that sometimes working hard is not as good as working smart and would
                        like to grow to become a person that can work smarter.
                        Time is a valuable thing and everyone wants to spend time with loved ones.
                        I used to give respect unconditionally but have learned that sometimes respect is best earned.
                        If I don't have anything to show for it I must work to show people what I am capable of.

                    <p>After talking and discussion with peers this is what I have found.</p>
                    <p>I am passionate in work that I am interested in. Problems are that I can focous to much on what I
                        am
                        interested in instead of spreading the time out for the other tasks. It's kind of like tunnel
                        vision.
                    </p>
                    <p>I talk about a topic passionately but end up cutting into what people say or change to topic
                        entirely
                        without
                        clear flow in coversation.</p>
                    <p>I like to tell the true but I am too blunt to some people and failed to see from other peoples
                        perspective.

                    <p>In terms of career development there are times where I felt Imposter syndrome and I loose
                        motivation and
                        confidence in my abilities.</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p>I have had a bad exprience working in a User Interface design project with 3 other teamates.
                        There were
                        two
                        teamates that didn't get along. One was an Apple fanatic, let's call him Sam, and the other
                        wanted to
                        get
                        the work done without delay, let's call him David.
                    </p>
                    <p>We were all working on a garden management application. Same wanted the UI to be based on Apples
                        IOS
                        design.
                        He also insited in using Sketch which had a problem. No one had Sratch on their computer or knew
                        how to
                        use
                        it. This lead to a disagreement with Sam and David. The project delayed because of failed
                        meetups.
                    </p>
                    <p>Sam wasn't budging and I had to find a solution. I decided to look for places to run Sketch as a
                        trial
                        and
                        found a spot in the University Library that had Mac Computers. I installed the trail and began
                        work on
                        the
                        project.
                    </p>
                    <p>I informed the team about this information and told them that if we do not finish our
                        project we
                        would fail the assignment. It didn't really work till it was the day before the drop in
                        date.
                    </p>
                    <p>The group was together finally but Sam and David were still at each other. I choose to
                        ignore
                        them
                        and continue working on Sketch till we had enough windows to do a walkthrough.
