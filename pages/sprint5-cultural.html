                            What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the
                            core
                            learning?

                            <li>
                                I may come across as arrogant when I say things are done as they should like. When using
                                let
                                over var. But my learning is not other peoples learning.

                                I know that I still have many things to learn and my process of building the calculator
                                is
                                still slow.

                                I like to think ahead sometimes but I should slow down and concentrate on the
                                requirements
                                first then do refactoring and updates later.

                        <p>
                            Doing simple things like going for a walk or taking a break can lead to more productive
                            workflows. Taking some time to reflect can help me with ideas that are stuck or concepts
                            that I haven’t grasped on.

                        <p>
                            Being consistent in using headspace and meditation. I don’t normally meditate as I said in
                            the previous blogs.

                            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core
                            learning in a web development bootcamp course?
                        </h3>

                        <p>
                            Core learning is important for self development. It also will help me improve my learning as
                            well in terms of motivation and love of programming. I have come to enjoy most of my time
                            doing it.

                            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you
                            have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            It may sometimes feel like a waste of time because it doesn’t come naturally to me because
                            yes you can spend more of the time pre-reading on React and stuff but over time this core
                            training will help me pace myself enjoy learning and enjoy life in the process.
