                        <p> My long term goal is to be a full stack web developer but still be an og. Another career
                            path I
                            could go to is in networking or game development

                            My strengths and limitations
                        </h2>
                        <p> My strengths is that I am reliable, always eager to learn and truthful.
                        </p>
                        <p> My limitations is that sometimes I can be a little too blunt and I need to be more tactful
                            as
                            well as compassionate to other people. I also need to gain more confidence so I don’t have
                            moments of
                            imposter syndrome.

                            How I will I manage my workload?
                        </h2>

                        <p>
                            I will try to work on time as well as work together with my teammates. If someone is behind
                            I
                            will
                            help but within reason so eg. When I have completed my work quickly or schedule a time to
                            help.
                            I
                            will try to ask for help form facilitators when I am in need because if I get stuck it will
                            cost
                            too
                            much time and I won’t be on schedule.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="title is-3">How will I committe to seeking help?</h2>
                        <p>
                            I will organize a time with the facilitator or other teammates if I am stuck. I can use
                            slack
                            for
                            quick easy questions.

                        <p>
                            I expect that they would be able to help guide me if I need help as well as feedback if I
                            think
                            I
                            have not done my task well.

                        <p>
                            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things.
                            Yes there will be quite a few block out times during my first weeks in Auckland as I need to
                            settle
                            a flat as well as possible job interviews in Auckland.
                        </p>
                        <p>I always use google calendar to schedule my events/tasks. I’ll try to use toggl to time my
                            workflow.
